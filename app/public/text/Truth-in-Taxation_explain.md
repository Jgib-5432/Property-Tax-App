# To Truth or not to Truth: Truth-in-Taxation Explained

Among governmental funding mechansims, property taxes feature prominently. Like other kinds of taxes, levies on property are generally strucutred as a rate that is charged against the underlying value being taxed. In the case of property taxes, that rate is assessed against the value of the property in question. For example, a local government might set a rate of .001% which would create a tax lability of $400 against a home worth $400,000. Importantly, the general strucutre of such taxes is to set the tax rate directly just like is done with a sales tax or an income tax.

In the case of property however, this structure creates a subtle problem. Property, particularly real property, has a habit of appriciating in value. Mostly, this is a good thing for the owner of the property since they can leverage the appriciated value for whatever purposes they deem worthwhile. They might borrow against the higher value, liquidate it by selling the property, or benefit from a number of other more complex financial products. However, in the event that the owner does not wish to part with their property for whatever reason, such as wanting to continue living in the house that they have owned for decades, a property tax which is strucutred as decribed here creates a situation wherein the tax liabilty continutly increases as the property apprciates in value.

This can be problematic for two reasons. First, it in effect raises taxes on a regular basis. The reason being that with a fixed rate, tax burden rises as value appriciates. If the home from the previous example were to increase in value to $500,000, the tax on it would rise to $500. This is different from something like a sale tax where, when the rate is held constant, aggregate liabilty would rise due to an individual choosing to increase consumption. With property taxes, fixed rates cause tax liabilty to increase almost automatically. Second, in general, the pattern of wealth over an individual's life is for it to increase with time until an inflection point where one's wealth begins declining. This pattern is driven by individuals on net building wealth over the early and middle decades of life by earning income and accumulating assests, and drawing down that wealth in the decades follwing retirement. As a consequence, there comes a point in the typical wealth profile where one's ability to pay increasing property tax liability diminishes at the same time that tax burden continues increasing due to value appriciation.

Here in Utah however, we do things a little bit differntly. Property taxes at all levels are contrained by a process called 'Truth in Taxation.'
It takes the ordinary tax paradigm and flips it on its head. The basic concept behind Truth in Taxation is to set the revenue to be raised, rather than setting the rate to charge More specifically, property tax rates are explicitly strucutred to float up and down in response to changes in the underlying taxable value. For example, if the house increases in value to $500,000, the rate would fall to .008% to maintain the same $400 of tax liabilty. If one aggregates the value of all taxable property in a juristiction and adjusts the rate levied by that juristiction to keep revenue constant, then one is following the basics of Truth in Taxation.
