This chart shows the share of taxable value for each major property type. The trends observed in the chart are the result of the changes in relative aggregate value between property types. For example, if the total value of residential property grows faster than that of the other property types, then it will make up a larger share of the total in the next year. Disperate growth rate might be due to market conditions driving values at differnt rates or the addition of more new property in one type or another.

These dynamics directly impact an individual taxpayer's liability. This is because the certified rate is calculated for the total taxable property regardless of how that total is split among the types. As such, if a type takes up an increasing share of the base, that type will take on an increasing share of the total liabilty.
