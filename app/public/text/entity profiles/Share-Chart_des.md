This chart shows the share of taxable value for each major property type. The trends observed in the chart are the result of the changes in relative value between property types. For example, if the total value of residential property grows faster than that of the other property types, then it will make up a larger share of the total in the next year. Disperate growth rate might be due to market conditions driving values at differnt rates or the addition of more new property in one type or another.
