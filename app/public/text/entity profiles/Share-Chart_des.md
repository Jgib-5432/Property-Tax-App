This chart shows the share of taxable value within the entity's jurisdiction from each major property type. The trends observed in the chart are the result of the changes in aggregate value of each tax type in relation to one another. For example, if the total value of residential property grows faster that that of the other property types in a given year, then it will make up a larger share of the total in the next year while the share of other types would decrease. Disperate growth rate might be due to market conditions driving values at differnt rates, the addition of more new property in one type or another.

These dynamics can have significant effects on the individual taxpayer's liability. This is because the certified rate is calculated with respect to the total taxable property regardless of how that total is split up amongst the types of property. As such, if a type of property takes up an increasing share of the base, that type will take on an increasing share of the total tax liabilty.
