This chart shows tax rate charged on property within the entity's jurisdiction by year. In general, charting tax rates through time should yeild a gently downward sloping line where rates in past years are greater than rates in more recent years. This is due to the mechanics of Truth in Taxation acting to lower the applied tax rate.

However, just because the rate is lowered does not mean that the tax liability is smaller for taxpayers. Whether or not that is the case depends on the specifics of their taxable property combined with the overall dynamics of the tax base.

In the event that an entity raises taxes, that can be observed in the chart as a marked single-year increase in the tax rate.
