This chart shows the tax rate charged on property within the entity's jurisdiction by year paired with the revenue that entity collects in millions. In general, charting tax rates through time should yeild a gently downward sloping line where rates in past years are greater than rates in more recent years. Similarly, the trend of revenue should be flat year-over-year since the prior year's revenue is the starting point for the current year's budget. This is due to the mechanics of Truth in Taxation acting to lower the applied tax rate.
