This chart shows the entities budgeted revenue by year. By default the trend of revenue should be flat year-over-year since Truth-in-Taxation sets the prior year's revenue as the starting point for the current year's budget. However, there are two ways that revenue trajectory can differ from this baseline. First, revenues can change if the entity elects to directly alter the amount to be collected via the Truth-in-Taxation process. Second, if the entity experiences new growth in the tax base, that growth does not count against the entity when computing the certified rate for the year that growth occured. As such, the tax collected on new property entering the tax base would constitute new revenue to the entity, thereby raising the total revenue collected both in that year and in subsequent years.
