This chart shows the entity's budgeted revenue by year. By default the trend of revenue should be flat year-over-year since Truth-in-Taxation sets the prior year's revenue as the starting point for the current year's budget. However, entities can see increases in revenue either from new growth in the tax base, or if it directly raises revnue via the Truth in Taxation process.
