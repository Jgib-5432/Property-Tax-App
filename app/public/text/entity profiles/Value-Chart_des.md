This chart shows the taxable value of property within the entity's juristriction by property type. The trends observed in the chart are the result of market conditions influencing the value of existing property as well as new property entering the tax base. For example, an existing home might appriciate by ten thousand dollars in a given year thereby adding that amount to the base. Alternative, a new home might be constructed adding its total value to the base. Either of these things could occur for any of the types of property.

These dynamics directly impact an individual taxpayer's liability. This is because the certified rate is calculated for the total taxable property regardless of how that total is split among the types.As such, if a type of property is growing in value faster that others, that type will take on an increasing share of the total tax liabilty.
