This chart shows the taxable value of property within the entity's juristriction by property type. The trends observed in the chart are the result of market conditions influencing the value of existing property as well as new property entering the tax base. For example, an existing home might appriciate by ten thousand dollars in a given year. This would add ten thousand dollars of taxable value into the base. Alternative, a new home might be constructed within a given year. If the home was worth $400,000, then that value is added into the base. Either of these things could occur for any of the different types of taxable property, and the aggregate net effect within each type influences the overall dynamic within the tax base.

These dynamics can have significant effects on the individual taxpayer's liabilty. This is because the certified rate is calculated with respect to the total taxable property regardless of how that total is split up amongst the types of property. As such, if a type of property is growing in value faster that others, that type will take on an increasing share of the total tax liabilty.
