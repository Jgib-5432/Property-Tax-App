Property subject to the age-based fee includes most vehicles such as passenger vehicles, motorcycles, vessels (under 31 ft), trailers, etc. (59-2-405).Rather than being assessed a percentage of the market value, age-based fees— as the name implies— levy a fixed charge against the underlying property. Generally paid concurrent with the vehicle's registration, the amount of the fee is determined by the property's age and type. For example, passenger vehicles face a different fee schedule that motorcycles. In all cases, the older a piece of property is, the smaller the associated fee. The full collection of fee schedules can be found on the Tax Commission's website: https://dmv.utah.gov/taxes-fees/uniform-fees
