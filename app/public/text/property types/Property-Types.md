# Property Types: Explained

In Utah, taxable property is divided into one of three broad categories as set out in statute: _real property_, _personal property_, and _centrally assessed property_. Of those, the first two are locally assessed, meaning that property is evaluated at the county level. This distinction in the code reflects how the property is used or structured; property that operates as a cohesive whole across multiple jurisdictions is assessed as a cohesive whole. A railroad network, for example, does not operate only in a single county and so is assessed at the state level rather than locally. By contrast, something that is fixed in place or registered with a single county (like a home, a business, or a vehicle) is assessed by that county. Click on the property types below to learn more.

## Real Property

Real Property refers to the land itself and improvements upon that land (59-2-102 (18), (32)). In this context, 'improvements' refer generally to buildings or structures attached to the land in a way which is permanent over the useful life of the property. The manner in which real property is taxed depends on the particular type of property at issue, but generally it is levied as a percentage rate on the fair market value of the property. See the categories below for more detail.

### Primary Residential

Primary residential property includes things like single family homes, duplexes, or other kinds of owner-occupied housing. It is defined in code as "any property used for residential purposes as a primary residence" (59-2-102(34)). The state constitution, among other property tax exemptions, carves out an exemption for up to 45% of the value of residential property (art. XIII, §3). At present, statute sets this exemption at the maximum allowed (59-2-103(3)), meaning that individuals pay taxes on 55% of their property's market value, rather than on the full value.

### Non-Primary Residential

Non-primary residential property includes all property classified as residential but not used as a primary residence. This may include second homes, vacation properties, rental buildings etc. Current statute excludes non-primary residential property from receiving the 45% exemption (59-2-103(6)) and so is taxed at 100% of market value.

### Commercial

Commercial property are those lands and improvements which are used for industrial or commercial purposes. Things like factories, office buildings, or department stores are all classified as commercial property for the purposes of taxation and are taxed at 100% of market value.

### Agricultural

Agricultural or FAA (Farmland Assessment Act) property, in contrast to other types of real property, is assessed based on its value for agricultural production rather than its market value (59-2-503). This may include land used to grow useful plants or raise livestock as defined in code.

### Unimproved

Unimproved or vacant property is land which has not been built upon or utilized. It is taxed at 100% of market value.

## Centrally Assessed

Centrally assessed property is primarily distinguished from other types of property since it is the Tax Commission rather than the counties which is responsible for assessment. State code lays out the specific types of property that the Commission is directly responsible for including that of public utilities, mobile flight equipment, geothermal resources, mines, or other property which "operates as a unit across county lines" (59-2-201). Each property is assessed as a whole before the value is apportioned among the taxing entities in which the property is located. For example, a railroad that runs through multiple counties, municipalities, school districts, etc. is assessed on its totality by the Commission, then the Commission determined what part of that total value is taxable by each entity in which the property exists. The taxing entities then levy their rates on the taxable value which has been apportioned to them.

## Personal Property

Personal Property is a broad category which includes everything from passenger cars to business equipment to mobile homes. While state code sets out the few explicit classifications (which are described below), it delegates rulemaking authority to the Tax Commission to create and maintain classifications for all other types of personal property (59-2-107). Due to the complexity, the intricacies of these classifications are not described here and can instead be found in the Commission's valuation guidelines: https://propertytax.utah.gov/personal/valuation-guidelines/

### Age-based Property

Property subject to the age-based fee includes most vehicles such as passenger vehicles, motorcycles, vessels (under 31 ft), trailers, etc. (59-2-405).Rather than being assessed a percentage of the market value, age-based fees— as the name implies— levy a fixed charge against the underlying property. Generally paid concurrent with the vehicle's registration, the amount of the fee is determined by the property's age and type. For example, passenger vehicles face a different fee schedule that motorcycles. In all cases, the older a piece of property is, the smaller the associated fee. The full collection of fee schedules can be found on the Tax Commission's website: https://dmv.utah.gov/taxes-fees/uniform-fees

### Fee-in-lieu Property

All vehicles not subject to the age-based fee, are instead subject to the fee-in-lieu. This fee is assessed as a percentage (1.5 or 1.0 depending on vehicle type) of the market value of the vehicle. This classification covers medium and heavy trucks, commercial trailers, vessels (31 ft or longer), and motor homes.

### Mobile Home

Mobile or manufactured homes are defined and classified similarly to residential property, including the distinction between primary and non-primary use. However, because such homes are ostensibly able to be moved to another site, they are not permanent improvement to the land over the useful life of the property. As such, mobile homes are considered personal property rather than real property. Even so, the 45% exemption enjoyed by primary residential property would also be enjoyed by a mobile home provided it is used as a primary residence. Otherwise, the property is taxed at 100% of market value.
