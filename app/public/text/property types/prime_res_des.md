Primary residential property includes things like single family homes, duplexes, or other kinds of owner-occupied housing. It is defined in code as "any property used for residential purposes as a primary residence" [(59-2-102)](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title59/Chapter2/59-2-S102.html?v=C59-2-S102_2025070120250507). The state constitution, among other property tax exemptions, carves out an exemption for up to 45% of the value of residential property [(art. XIII, ยง3)](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/ArticleXIII/Article_XIII,_Section_3.html?v=UC_AXIII_S3_2018050820190101)]. At present, statute sets this exemption at the maximum allowed [(59-2-103)](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title59/Chapter2/59-2-S103.html?v=C59-2-S103_2025070120250507), meaning that individuals pay taxes on 55% of their property's market value, rather than on the full value.
