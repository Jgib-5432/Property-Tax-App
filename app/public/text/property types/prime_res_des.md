Primary residential property includes things like single family homes, duplexes, or other kinds of owner-occupied housing. It is defined in code as "any property used for residential purposes as a primary residence" (59-2-102(34)). The state constitution, among other property tax exemptions, carves out an exemption for up to 45% of the value of residential property (art. XIII, ยง3). At present, statute sets this exemption at the maximum allowed (59-2-103(3)), meaning that individuals pay taxes on 55% of their property's market value, rather than on the full value.
