Mobile or manufactured homes are defined and classified similarly to residential property, including the distinction between primary and non-primary use. However, because such homes are ostensibly able to be moved to another site, they are not permanent improvement to the land over the useful life of the property. As such, mobile homes are considered personal property rather than real property. Even so, the 45% exemption enjoyed by primary residential property would also be enjoyed by a mobile home provided it is used as a primary residence. Otherwise, the property is taxed at 100% of market value.
