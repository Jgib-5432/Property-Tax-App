In Utah, taxable property is divided into one of three broad categories as set out in statute: _real property_, _personal property_, and _centrally assessed property_. Of those, the first two are locally assessed, meaning that property is evaluated at the county level. In contrast, centrally assessed property is evaluated by the state tax commission. This distinction in the code reflects how the property is used or structured; property that operates as a cohesive whole across multiple jurisdictions is assessed as a cohesive whole. A railroad network, for example, does not operate only in a single county and so is assessed at the state level rather than locally. Conversely, something that is fixed in place or registered with a single county (like a home, a business, or a vehicle) is assessed by that county. Click on the property types below to learn more.
