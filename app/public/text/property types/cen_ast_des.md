Centrally assessed property is primarily distinguished from other types of property since it is the Tax Commission rather than the counties which is responsible for assessment. State code lays out the specific types of property that the Commission is directly responsible for including that of public utilities, mobile flight equipment, geothermal resources, mines, or other property which "operates as a unit across county lines" [(59-2-201)](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title59/Chapter2/59-2-S201.html?v=C59-2-S201_2025010120240501). Each property is assessed as a whole before the value is apportioned among the taxing entities in which the property is located. For example, a railroad that runs through multiple counties, municipalities, school districts, etc. is assessed on its totality by the Commission, then the Commission determines what part of that total value is taxable by each entity in which the property exists. The taxing entities then levy their rates on the taxable value which has been apportioned to them.
