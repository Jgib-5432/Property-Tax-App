Personal Property is a broad category which includes everything from passenger cars to business equipment to mobile homes. While state code sets out the few explicit classifications (which are described below), it delegates rulemaking authority to the Tax Commission to create and maintain classifications for all other types of personal property (59-2-107). Due to the complexity, the details of these classifications are not described here and can instead be found in the Commission's [valuation guidelines](https://propertytax.utah.gov/personal/valuation-guidelines/)
