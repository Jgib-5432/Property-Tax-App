Non-primary residential property includes all property classified as residential but not used as a primary residence. This may include second homes, vacation properties, rental buildings etc. Current statute excludes non-primary residential property from receiving the 45% exemption [(59-2-103)](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title59/Chapter2/59-2-S103.html?v=C59-2-S103_2025070120250507) and so is taxed at 100% of market value.
