## Cuts

<!---
The structure of Truth in Taxation begs an obvious question: if the system enforces flat revenues year-to-year, how is a taxing entity supposed to maintain services in the face of rising costs? After all, governments are not immune to inflation or other economic trends. Moreover, what if a taxing entity wants to increase the quality or quantity of services provided to its residents, such as when a school district needs to hire more teachers as the population of school-age children grows? How are such services meant to be funded? Enforced flat revenues by themselves cannot meet these needs.

Truth in Taxation contains a process for a taxing entity to raise the level of revenues it collects. In other words, under Truth in Taxation, taxing entities retain the ability to raise taxes. In order to do that, an entity must send a notification to residents of the proposed tax increase, how much that tax increase would cost the taxpayer, and how that costs compare to the tax liability from the prior year. Following the notification, the entity must hold a public meeting wherein residents are afforded the opportunity to provide comment on the proposal. After that, then and only then can a taxing entity take action to officially raise the level of revenue that they collect.
